NOTE: balloons.html is an example implementation.  
You will have to edit the image and javascript URLs to match your own system's architecture.

Please consult the documentation at 
http://gmod.org/wiki/Popup_Balloons

This is a fairly complex library and is not trivial to set up.  
Most common implementation errors are typos or not getting the image or JavaScript paths/URLs right.  
Please check each of these carefully if you get 'balloon is not defined' type errors or you see text with no balloons.
