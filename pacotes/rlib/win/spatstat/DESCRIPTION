Description: A package for analysing spatial data, mainly Spatial Point
        Patterns, including multitype/marked points and spatial
        covariates, in any two-dimensional spatial region. Contains
        functions for exploratory data analysis, model-fitting,
        simulation, spatial sampling, model diagnostics, and formal
        inference. Data types include point patterns, line segment
        patterns, spatial windows, and pixel images. Point process
        models can be fitted to point pattern data. Cluster type models
        are fitted by the method of minimum contrast. Very general
        Gibbs point process models can be fitted to point pattern data
        using a function ppm similar to lm or glm. Models may include
        dependence on covariates, interpoint interaction and dependence
        on marks. Fitted models can be simulated automatically. Also
        provides facilities for formal inference (such as chi-squared
        tests) and model diagnostics (including simulation envelopes,
        residuals, residual plots and Q-Q plots).
