<h2>Humberside Data on Childhood Leukaemia and Lymphoma</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Spatial locations of cases of childhood leukaemia
and lymphoma, and randomly-selected controls,
in North Humberside.
A marked point pattern.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>data(humberside)</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>
The dataset <code>humberside</code> is
an object of class <code>"ppp"</code>
representing a marked point pattern.
Entries include
<table summary="Rd table">
<tr>
  <td align="left"><code>x</code> </td>  <td align="left"> Cartesian <i>x</i>-coordinate of home address </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left"> <code>y</code> </td>  <td align="left"> Cartesian <i>y</i>-coordinate of home address </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left"> <code>marks</code> </td>  <td align="left"> factor with levels <code>case</code> and <code>control</code> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left"> </td>  <td align="left"> indicating whether this is a disease case</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td align="left"> </td>  <td align="left"> or a control. </td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
See <code><a href="ppp.object.html">ppp.object</a></code> for details of the format.
</p>
<p>
The dataset <code>humberside.convex</code> is an object of the
same format, representing the same point pattern data,
but contained in a larger, 5-sided convex polygon.
</p>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>
Cuzick and Edwards (1990) first presented and analysed these data.
</p>
<p>
The data record 62 cases of childhood leukaemia and lymphoma
diagnosed in the North Humberside region of England between 1974 and
1986, together with 141 controls selected at random from the birth
register for the same period.
</p>
<p>
The data are represented as a marked point pattern,
with the points giving the spatial location of each individual's home address
(actually, the centroid for the postal code)
and the marks identifying cases and controls.
</p>
<p>
Coordinates are in multiples of 100 metres, and the resolution is
100 metres.
</p>
<p>
Two versions of the dataset are supplied, both containing the
same point coordinates, but using different windows.
The dataset <code>humberside</code> has a polygonal window with 102 edges
which closely approximates the Humberside region,
while <code>humberside.convex</code> has a convex 5-sided polygonal window 
originally used by Diggle and Chetwynd (1991) and shown in
Figure 1 of that paper.
