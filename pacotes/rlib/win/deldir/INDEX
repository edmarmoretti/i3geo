deldir                  Construct the Delaunay triangulation and the
                        Dirichlet (Voronoi) tessellation of a planar
                        point set.
plot.deldir             Produce a plot of the Delaunay triangulation
                        and Dirichlet (Voronoi) tesselation of a planar
                        point set, as constructed by the function
                        deldir.
plot.tile.list          Plot Dirchlet/Voronoi tiles
tile.list               Create a list of tiles in a tessellation.
